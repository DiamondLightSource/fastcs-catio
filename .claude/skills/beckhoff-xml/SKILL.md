# beckhoff-xml

Working with Beckhoff ESI XML files and the terminal YAML files this
repo generates from them.

## Critical rule — terminal YAMLs are generated

**Never manually edit** YAML files in `src/catio_terminals/terminals/`.
They are generated from Beckhoff ESI XML by code in
`src/catio_terminals/xml/`. If a YAML has wrong values:

1. Fix the XML parsing code that produced it.
2. Regenerate with `uv run catio-terminals clean-yaml <file>` (default
   target: `src/catio_terminals/terminals/terminal_types.yaml`).
3. Manual edits are lost on next regeneration.

Group-specific logic lives in `process_pdo_entries()` in
`src/catio_terminals/xml/pdo.py`. Special cases:

- Index groups default to `0xF031` / `0xF021` for standard I/O.
- Counter terminals (`group_type="Measuring"`) use `0xF030` / `0xF020`.

## Where the XML lives

- Cached at `~/.cache/catio_terminals/beckhoff_xml/`.
- Refresh with `catio-terminals update-cache`.
- Edit YAMLs with the GUI via `catio-terminals edit [filename]` (but
  remember: regenerate, don't hand-edit).
- ESI files are grouped by series, e.g. `Beckhoff EL31xx.xml` contains
  EL3104, EL3124, …; `Beckhoff EL32xx.xml` contains EL3202, EL3204, …

## XML → YAML field mapping

| XML | YAML |
|-----|------|
| `Type@ProductCode` | `identity.product_code` |
| `Type@RevisionNo` | `identity.revision_number` |
| `TxPdo/Entry` | `symbol_nodes[]` (inputs) |
| `RxPdo/Entry` | `symbol_nodes[]` (outputs) |
| `Profile/Dictionary/Objects` | `coe_objects[]` |

## What the XML does NOT contain

- Composite type names — assigned by our XML parser.
- ADS offsets — computed at runtime.
- Some symbols like `WcState` are ADS runtime symbols, not XML-defined.

See [terminal-yaml-definitions.md](../../../docs/explanations/terminal-yaml-definitions.md)
for the distinction between XML-defined symbols and ADS runtime
symbols.

## Reference documents

Read these when context isn't already loaded:

- [docs/reference/beckhoff-xml-format.md](../../../docs/reference/beckhoff-xml-format.md)
  — ESI XML schema (Device, TxPdo, RxPdo, Entry, CoE objects), file
  naming conventions, what's NOT in XML.
- [docs/explanations/terminal-yaml-definitions.md](../../../docs/explanations/terminal-yaml-definitions.md)
  — Terminal YAML structure (identity, symbol_nodes, coe_objects),
  SymbolNode fields, computed properties, channel templating.
- [docs/explanations/composite-types.md](../../../docs/explanations/composite-types.md)
  — Composite type definitions.

  symbol-count mismatches usually trace back to XML parsing bugs.
