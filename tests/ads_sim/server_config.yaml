# EtherCAT Chain Configuration for ADS Simulation Server
# ========================================================
#
# This file defines the server configuration and device instances.
# Terminal type definitions are loaded from separate YAML files in
# src/fastcs_catio/terminals/
#
# Device configuration references terminal types by name (e.g., "EL2024").
# The EtherCATChain class will load terminal type definitions from
# the separate YAML files.
