# catio

Control system integration of EtherCAT I/O devices running under TwinCAT using pyads and FastCS

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from catio import __version__

print(f"Hello catio {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m catio --version
```
